# Names & Tags

## Naming a `Container`

We can assign a `name` to a container (instead of using the autogenerated) if we pass the
`--name` flag `docker run --name my_container [image:id/name]`

```shell
docker run -p 3000:80 -d --name rest-example 228eedf1b6f0
```

```shell-output
docker ps   
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
7c982ff282e6   228eedf1b6f0   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:3000->80/tcp   rest-example
```

## Naming and Tagging an `Image`

When we build images we can also provide a `tag` (similar to a `name` in the container) to have a better control
The tag consists of 2 parts `[repository:tag]` for example `NODE` image the repository is `node` and tag is `latest`

```shell-output
docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
node         latest    341640cdfda9   2 weeks ago      1.1GB
```

These 2 values combined will give you a unique identifier

```shell
docker build -t my_image:latest .
```

```shell-output
docker build -t node_rest:latest .

If you want to remove all images including those which were tagged
```shell
docker image prune -a
```
